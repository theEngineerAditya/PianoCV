# PianoCV
Author: Aditya Sinha

Overview
This project is a Python-based application that uses computer vision and MIDI to create a virtual musical instrument. By tracking hand gestures with a webcam, the program plays chords corresponding to specific finger positions. The chords are mapped to the D Major scale and are played using the Pygame MIDI library.

Features
Hand Tracking: Detects hands and tracks finger positions using OpenCV and the CVZone HandTrackingModule.

MIDI Integration: Plays chords in real-time based on finger gestures using Pygame MIDI.

Chord Mapping: Each finger is associated with a chord from the D Major scale.

Sustain Effect: Chords sustain for a specified time after the finger is lowered.


Requirements:
OpenCV
CVZone
Pygame
Threading
Time module
